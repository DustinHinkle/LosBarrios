Assignment #7

Introduction

This guide will describe how our team incorporated scrum into our group final project. We will outline the methodology, strategy, and effectiveness of our use of scrum. This guide will discuss how we agreed upon the different goals and processes that will be used to create our project. It will also describe the difficulties and the pitfalls that we encountered while using scrum.

Progression Check-List

Determine Sprint timings

        -Determine sprint length

        -Determine sprint meetings

        -Decide on your definition of “Done”

Create PBIs

        -Meet with the product owner

-Create user stories for features

Estimate Value

        -Play planning poker to assign values

        -Create PBI List

Assign PBIs        

-Assign each member their task for the sprint

-Reevaluate values if needed

End of Sprint Meeting

        -Evaluate complete or incomplete PBIs

-If necessary identify where we have technical debt

-New plans for future sprints should be incremental to what is already accomplished

Sprint Guide

Our sprint length was essentially decided for us by the limitation of the school semester. We choose two-week sprints to accomplish our set goals. Naturally, our meetings were held at a time that all of us could attend for around two hours. These came not due to an overall decision but a time that fit all of our schedules. We would meet twice a week on Thursday and Sunday. Thursday would be a day for updates and progress and Sunday is the day that we would show our work for that sprint. The way we decided on if a sprint was completed was through a Definition-of-Done Checklist. This list holds all the tasks for a member to complete within the sprint. The items that go on this checklist should be possible and agreed upon by the group. The book explains the difference between done and done-done which is useful for understanding when you are done. “Done” is working code and “Done-Done” is code that is ready to be shipped aka final code.

General Definition of Done Checklist:

    Design Reviewed
    Code Completed

    Code refactored
    Code commented
    Code committed and pushed to Git repository 

    Tested 

    Unit Tested

    Zero Known defects 

Requirements and User Stories         

Sprint 1

List of user stores:

        Feature: Register

As a Los Barrios user, I want the ability to register as a member of the website so that I can access relevant information to my statutes

        Acceptance Criteria:

Given a registration page when I enter in my information then I am granted access to log in as a member  

        Feature: Login

As a Los Barrios member, I want the ability to log in so that I can access needed information

        Acceptance Criteria:

Given a login page when I enter in my login information then I am taken to the main webpage

Technical work and knowledge acquisitions are product backlog items that do not carry much weight in the final product build but are useful for team members to increase efficiency.

As a developer, I need to increase my knowledge in identity framework so that I can develop a registration/login for the program.

 

Story Mapping:

EPIC: Register for login access

Theme: Register

Story: Register for Los Barrios

Story: Log into Los Barrios

Story mapping is a way to confirm with the product owner that understanding of the final goal aka the big picture is the same. This allows for people with less technical understanding to grasp the workflow of the project.

Product Backlog Items

There is a hierarchy of product backlog items (PBIs) where the more important to the overall product the PBI is then the more weight it carries. In order of importance, PBIs are features, defects, technical work, and knowledge acquisition. User stories are the main type of logging and completing PBIs. A user story of a feature is akin to a user of the program wanting a change or addition to the program so that the program is either more useful or accessible to the user. Not every scenario has to be included in the first pass of creating a PBI list. As is the nature of creating something, errors and unforeseen additions will be made and added to the list. This is known as grooming your product backlog. Grooming is when the product owner and team manage the list of PBIs to understand what is most important to the product owner. For each product owner, there will be a different definition of when a PBI is ready to be moved into a sprint. A checklist is used to understand that the PBI is consistent with what the product owner needs, the details of the situation are understood and the workload can be estimated, and if there are any other factors that would prevent the PBI from being completed.

Estimating and Velocity

Once a PBI list has been completed and groomed then comes the estimation of how difficult each PBI is. The most common way of deciding the difficulty of a PBI is planning poker. Each member of the team has cards that vary in value, a PBI is brought up and the members cast their cards on how difficult the PBI is to complete during a sprint, usually the higher the value the more difficult the situation. If there is a difference in opinion then the group will discuss why they think it is difficult and then choose the appropriate value. Once a value has been chosen it does not have to remain that value. During a scrum meeting, the value can be re-estimated and increased or decreased based on commitment. We only used this method and it was adequate in estimating tasks. Velocity refers to the amount of work that is completed during a sprint. You measure velocity with the sum of all completed PBIs during the sprint. Only finished PBIs are included in this measure. Velocity is not about the value of the product that was finished but the size of what was finished. Velocity is used to calculate how much work a team can accomplish within a sprint. This will help the product owner estimate how long it will take for the final release. We used velocity to understand how much work we needed to accomplish to have a shippable product by the end of the class. Using our assigned values to each PBI we know the sum of all PBIs and the number of sprints we have. Using the sum divided by sprint count we get the number of tasks that need to be completed each sprint.

Technical Debt

How we will go about identifying and servicing technical debt, technical debt first needs a definition. Technical debt is either bad design, many known defects, or the inability to test code in an automated way. Through refactoring code and aiming for test driven development, we can  put ourselves on the path for less technical debt and quickly have the code that is created easily testable. As we complete tasks it is important to have a strong definition of done and evaluate if our definition of done as it is used currently meets the expectation. As issues arise we should if feasible during that sprint aim to remedy it as we find it.

Perform test-driven development as well as refactoring while creating code.

Evaluate if done is being used meets expectations.

Evaluate how it was it is designed and where it falls short

Scrum Planning Principles

        During the start of sprints, while we look back on what was done well and what works out for the team, what is needed for the next week and so on is not pre-planned. As plans or goals change it is important not to be dead set on the original plan as not to waste too much time. As we meet we should evaluate where we have gone and where to go next in regard to the overall project as we make incremental steps. Though having an overall “plan” is useful for guidance, our plan is coming in the form of what is the overall goal that we talk of during our meetings.

        Having an overall goal is good. Having a plan for everything is bad.

        Time management is important.

        Incremental plans are important.

        Plans may change.
